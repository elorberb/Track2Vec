### Introduction

This is the submission of team wwweiwei to the [EvalRS Data Challenge](https://github.com/RecList/evalRS-CIKM-2022).

### Instructions

_Preliminaries_

* Launch an Amazon Deep Learning AMI _Tensorflow image_.
* Install the packages in the `requirements.txt` file in the ready-made TF interpreter.
* Important: make sure you are running TF 2.9 (it is in the requirements, but please make sure!).

_Custom test_

* As requested by the rules, we submit a custom test together with the ones in the original RecList. In particular, the class `myRecList(EvalRSRecList)` contains our custom test, which is also described in our short paper.
